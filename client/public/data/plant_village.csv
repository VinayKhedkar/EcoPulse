0,Pepper Bell - Bacterial Spot,"Use disease-free seeds and transplants by sourcing certified, pathogen-free materials.Rotate crops with non-host plants such as cereals for at least two to three years to reduce bacterial persistence in the soil. Remove and destroy infected plant debris to minimize bacterial survival. Avoid overhead irrigation and use drip irrigation to reduce leaf wetness, which helps prevent bacterial spread. Apply copper-based fungicides such as copper hydroxide or copper sulfate preventively, rotating treatments to prevent resistance. Use a mixture of mancozeb and copper as an effective treatment in the early stages of infection. Apply bactericides such as streptomycin or kasugamycin in nurseries, but with caution to avoid resistance development. Utilize beneficial bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma species, which can suppress bacterial growth. Consider plant-based treatments such as neem oil, which has demonstrated antibacterial properties. Whenever possible, plant resistant pepper cultivars, as they provide a long-term solution to bacterial spot management."
